# Research Log

## 2021-10-20

Extracted the FT expression data into a CSV `data/exp_pro/2021-08-10_expression-levels/ft.csv`, and
implemented a script to plot the data `scripts/ft-plot.jl`. We then implemented a script to fit
Model 3's parameters to the data, `scripts/ft-model-fit.jl`.

## 2021-08-10

Recieved data from Rishi on expression levels of FT, GA20OX-1 and AGL8 under various treatments of
cold/warm temperatures as well as time series of bud-break of three genetic variants: T89 (wild
type), ABI1-1 and RCAR1-RNAi. The raw data and a powerpoint synopsis can be found in
`data/exp_raw/2021-08-10_expression-levels`.

## 2021-09-03

Completed writing the core modeling framework.
